# C--STL-conversion
C# program enabling .STL files binary to ASCII conversion + calculating Volume of the Model

HOW DOES IT WORK?
If u have a .STL binary file, you can convert it to ASCII file so it will be readable by text editors.
Declare the input path in line 107 and the output path in line 109. 

Program also enables the user to get the volume of the model. It will be displayed in the console as "double" type.

NOTE:
I tested the program on STL files up to 5 MB, larger files should work fine, just will take more time for computation.
If you encounter any problems please create an issu, I will do my best to help.
